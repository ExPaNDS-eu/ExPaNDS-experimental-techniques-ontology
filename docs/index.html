                    <p>PaNET is a comprehensive, semi-hierarchical vocabulary dedicated to Photon and Neutron Experimental Techniques. A technique is defined by four major aspects</p>

                    <ul class="md-itemization">
                        <li><strong>experimental physical probe</strong></li>

                        <li><strong>experimental probe</strong></li>

                        <li><strong>functional dependence</strong></li>

                        <li><strong>purpose</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <img id="panet_scheme" src="images/PaNET_scheme.svg" alt="PaNET scheme. Users of a PaN facility have a specific scientific question about a sample (the purpose of the experiment). To address this query, they select an appropriate technique, characterized by the physical probe (e.g. x-rays) and the interaction (process) it induces within the sample. The experiment can tehn be executed under varied external conditions (dependence of e.g. temperature).">
                    

                    <p>Something is a technique in the scope of PaNET, if</p>
                    <ul class="md-itemization">
                        <li><strong>the technique is in use, or has been used in the past, at a large European photon or neutron facility.</strong> Facility-members of LEAPS and LENS are examples of such facilities, as are ESFRI-recognised facilities such as ELI.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>the technique takes advantage of one of the facility's beamlines.</strong> A technique is not eligible merely for taking place within a facility's campus.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>the technique distinguishes itself from other techniques NOT only by the choice of the sample or the sample's state.</strong> This criterion may be overruled if there is a very strong view from the user community that the sample is fundamental to the technique definition.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>the technique distinguishes itself from another technique by an essential dependency on some well-defined sample interaction.</strong> A laser pump-probe is an example of such an interaction.</li>
