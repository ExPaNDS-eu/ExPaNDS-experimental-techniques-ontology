# Changelog for version 1.1.0

## Minor enhancements and bug-fixes.

- http://purl.org/pan-science/PaNET/PaNET01146:
  
Change label to 'photoemission electron microscopy' for better consistency with community usage.
  
- http://purl.org/pan-science/PaNET/PaNET01107 (inelastic small angle scattering):

Fix typo in label

- http://purl.org/pan-science/PaNET/PaNET01125 (spectroscopy):

Remove equivalence to 'versus energy' as this wrongly classifies MAD as spectroscopy.

- http://purl.org/pan-science/PaNET/PaNET01124 (small angle scattering):

No longer a subclass of 'diffraction' (which was an error).

- Internal update: Add disjoint classes to Robot CSV file for easier implementation of disjoints.
  
- http://purl.org/pan-science/PaNET/PaNET01034 ('inelastic scattering') & http://purl.org/pan-science/PaNET/PaNET01020 ('elastic scattering')

Now defined as being disjoint classes.
