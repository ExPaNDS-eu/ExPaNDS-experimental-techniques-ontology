# ExPaNDS Photon and Neutron Experimental Techniques (PaNET) ontology

The Photon and Neutron Experimental Technique (PaNET) ontology provides a taxonomy of experimental techniques relevant for the Photon and Neutron (PaN) community. This ontology is being developed as part of the [Work Package 3 on EOSC Data Catalogue Services for PaN national Research Infrastructures](https://expands-eu.github.io/WP1-reporting/reports-wp/reports-wp3.html) of the [ExPaNDS project](https://expands.eu/).


The ontology allows to add semantic tags to datasets, and other related research objects, to indicate the experimental technique(s) that was (or were) used to create them.

This repository is structured as follows:
- the **doc** folder contains the ontology documentation
- the **meetings** folder contains documents related to the WP3 discussions on the ontology
- the **source** folder contains a CSV file with the list of experimental techniques and its relationships, which is used to generate the associated ontology file using the Web Ontology Language (OWL).
