<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
An ontology of experimental techniques within the photon and neutron (PaN) domain.

Purpose

The main purpose of this ontology is to provide a controlled vocabulary, global PIDs and annotations 
for photon and neutron techniques, to support PaN FAIR data catalogue functionality.

Design philosophy

In this simple ontology everything is a class and all classes are techniques. Object property relations
are implied but not formalized in this version. Subclass/superclass relationships and intersections are 
used to define specific technique classes in terms of broader superclasses. This is seen as a key
requirement in order to carry out catalogue searcher for broader concepts, for example.

This project was undertaken under ExPaNDS WP3.2 (https://expands.eu/)
